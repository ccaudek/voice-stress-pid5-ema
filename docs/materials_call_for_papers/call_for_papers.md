## Background
Personality pathology unfolds in dynamic, real-world settings, shaped by nested layers of environmental context—from immediate interpersonal encounters to broader cultural and structural forces. Any understanding of personality functioning is incomplete without accounting for these multilevel influences and the real-time person × environment interactions through which pathology is expressed and maintained. While it is widely acknowledged that context matters, empirical research has lagged behind theory in developing rigorous methods to assess and model context itself—particularly within ambulatory assessment frameworks. Capturing both proximal triggers (e.g., interpersonal conflict, situational stress) and distal conditions (e.g., socioeconomic disadvantage, systemic discrimination) is essential for advancing models of personality pathology that reflect how people operate within, and are shaped by, the environments they inhabit.

## Special issue aims
This special issue seeks to move personality disorder research beyond generic invocations of “context matters” toward methodologically rigorous approaches that capture the complex, transactional nature of personality pathology as it unfolds in situ. While maladaptive traits are widely assumed to reflect context-dependent processes, there has been little empirical work developing methods operationalizing and modeling those processes—particularly in ways that align with the temporal resolution and ecological validity needed to detect within-person dynamics. At the proximal level, we are especially interested in contributions that refine the assessment of interpersonal situations given their centrality to the expression and maintenance of personality pathology. Other situational contingencies, such as stressors, are also relevant. Equally important are studies that situate these everyday dynamics within broader ecological systems that can constrain, evoke, or exacerbate maladaptive personality patterns, such as neighborhood characteristics, cultural frameworks, and socioeconomic conditions. By foregrounding these multilevel contexts and the mechanisms through which they shape symptom expression, this issue aims to bridge the persistent gap between decontextualized trait models and the lived realities of individuals with personality pathology, thereby advancing both theoretical precision and clinical utility.

We invite submissions that:

**Introduce or apply innovative methods for capturing context in ambulatory assessment**, particularly approaches that go beyond self-report to address limitations of traditional ecological momentary assessment (EMA). This includes the use of passive sensing (e.g., GPS, audio, social media activity), psychophysiological monitoring (e.g., heart rate variability, electrodermal activity) as indicators of situational stress, and natural language processing applied to open-ended EMA responses or recorded interpersonal interactions. We are especially interested in multimodal designs that enhance ecological validity, increase temporal resolution, and capture dimensions of context—such as social network structure, affective tone, and the physical environment—that are not easily accessible through EMA questionnaires alone.

**Model the impact of context on personality pathology across multiple levels**, from proximal triggers (e.g., interpersonal conflict, perceived rejection, invalidation) to distal and enduring influences (e.g., chronic stress exposure, systemic discrimination, neighborhood disadvantage) on momentary processes, in ways that illuminate how contextual factors evoke, amplify, or attenuate maladaptive trait expression, predict functional outcomes over time, or buffer against dysfunction.

## Submission details
Submissions should be focused on dimensional models of personality pathology (e.g., AMPD, ICD-11, PID-5) as opposed to categorical diagnostic constructs.

Please email a short proposal that includes a title and abstract to Vize, Ringwald, and Kaurin by November 14, 2025. Authors invited to submit full manuscripts will be asked to do so by February 14, 2026.
