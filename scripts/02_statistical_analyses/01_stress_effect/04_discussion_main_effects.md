# Discussion: Main Effects of Exam Stress on Vocal Production

## Overview: A Dual-Process Model of Vocal Stress Response

The present findings reveal that acute exam-related stress modulates vocal production along two partially dissociable dimensions, reflecting increased physiological arousal and enhanced phonatory control. Specifically, stress was associated with a robust elevation of fundamental frequency (F0), alongside a concurrent reduction in glottal noise indexed by more negative Normalized Noise Energy (NNE) values. Taken together, these patterns indicate that acute academic stress does not merely destabilize vocal production, but instead induces a more controlled and tension-driven phonatory state. Below, we consider the theoretical and physiological implications of each finding before discussing their broader significance.

## Fundamental Frequency: Arousal-Driven Pitch Elevation

The stress-related increase in F0 observed in this study is consistent with extensive prior evidence linking psychological stress and autonomic arousal to heightened laryngeal muscle activation and increased subglottal pressure. During stress, sympathetic nervous system activation promotes increased tension in the cricothyroid and vocalis muscles, leading to greater vocal fold stiffness and corresponding increases in vibratory frequency. This mechanism aligns with broader patterns in the stress literature, where F0 elevation has been reliably documented across diverse stressors including public speaking tasks, cognitive load manipulations, and real-world performance contexts.

Crucially, the present findings extend this literature by demonstrating that F0 elevation occurs not only under experimentally controlled conditions, but also in response to naturalistic academic stress experienced by university students facing high-stakes examinations. The magnitude and consistency of the F0 increase—observed at both the group level and with substantial between-person variability—underscore the robustness of this vocal marker of stress. Moreover, the use of hierarchical Bayesian models allowed us to quantify both the average stress effect and the considerable individual differences in stress reactivity, revealing that while pitch elevation is a near-universal response to acute stress, its magnitude varies systematically across individuals.

## Normalized Noise Energy: Control-Driven Reduction in Glottal Noise

In striking contrast to the arousal-related increase in F0, changes in NNE followed a fundamentally different pattern. Rather than increasing under stress—as might be expected if stress primarily induced vocal instability or breakdown—NNE *decreased*, indicating reduced glottal noise and a more periodic, harmonically stable signal. This effect was consistent across descriptive analyses and hierarchical Bayesian modeling, providing strong evidence that exam stress does not compromise phonatory quality but instead promotes a "cleaner" acoustic output.

From a physiological perspective, this pattern is compatible with stress-induced hyperadduction or increased laryngeal tension leading to a "pressed" voice quality. Under heightened arousal, speakers may unconsciously adopt compensatory phonatory strategies that involve firmer vocal fold closure and more sustained contact during each glottal cycle. While such adaptations produce acoustically cleaner signals, they come at a potential cost: pressed phonation is less flexible, more effortful, and—if sustained over extended periods—may contribute to vocal fatigue or strain.

Importantly, the reduction in NNE was evident across participants and showed minimal evidence of moderation by personality traits in subsequent analyses (see moderation section). This uniformity suggests that the control-related component of the vocal stress response operates via a more automatic, less trait-dependent physiological mechanism than the arousal-driven F0 response. In other words, while individuals differ in how much their pitch rises under stress (a phenomenon linked to emotional reactivity and trait Negative Affectivity), the tendency to adopt a more controlled, pressed phonatory style appears to be a more universal adaptation to acute performance demands.

## Dissociation Between Arousal and Control: Theoretical Implications

The dissociation between F0 and NNE is perhaps the most theoretically significant finding of this study. It reveals that vocal responses to stress are not unidimensional but instead reflect at least two distinct underlying processes: arousal-driven changes in pitch (F0) and control-driven adjustments in phonatory quality (NNE). This dual-process framework has important implications for how we conceptualize stress-related vocal changes.

First, it challenges simplistic models that treat vocal stress responses as a form of "degradation" or "breakdown." While some acoustic parameters (e.g., shimmer, jitter) may indeed increase under extreme stress, the present findings show that acute, manageable stress elicits coordinated adjustments that simultaneously reflect heightened arousal and compensatory control. This pattern is more consistent with theories emphasizing adaptive regulation under stress than with models positing mere disruption.

Second, the dissociation between F0 and NNE underscores the importance of measuring multiple acoustic dimensions when studying stress. Relying on a single parameter—such as pitch alone—would miss critical aspects of the stress response, including phonatory quality changes that may have distinct psychological and physiological underpinnings. Multi-parameter approaches thus offer a richer, more nuanced picture of how stress reshapes vocal behavior.

Third, the differential sensitivity of F0 and NNE to personality moderation (discussed in subsequent sections) suggests that arousal-related and control-related vocal responses may be governed by partially independent neural and muscular systems. While sympathetic activation directly influences F0 via laryngeal tension, phonatory control adjustments indexed by NNE may involve more volitional or habitual compensatory strategies that are less strongly tied to trait-level emotional reactivity.

## Methodological Considerations and Implications

The present conclusions were enabled by hierarchical Bayesian modeling, which allowed us to partition variance at multiple levels (within-person, between-person, residual) and explicitly model both fixed and random effects of stress. This approach revealed clear population-level trends while also quantifying substantial individual variability—a feature often obscured in conventional mixed-effects analyses or aggregated designs. By incorporating uncertainty at all levels of the model, we gained a more complete understanding of both the central tendencies and the heterogeneity in vocal stress responses.

Moreover, the use of two orthogonal contrasts (stress vs. baseline, and recovery vs. stress) enabled us to distinguish between the initial impact of stress and subsequent recovery dynamics. While the stress contrast consistently revealed strong effects for both F0 and NNE, the recovery contrast showed more variable patterns depending on the specific parameter. This temporal decomposition is critical for understanding not just whether stress affects the voice, but also how rapidly these effects emerge and dissipate—information that has both theoretical and applied relevance for understanding stress regulation and vocal health.

## Broader Significance and Future Directions

The findings reported here contribute to a growing body of evidence positioning vocal acoustics as a valuable, non-invasive window into stress physiology and psychological state. Unlike self-report measures, which are subject to demand characteristics and introspective limitations, and unlike physiological measures such as cortisol or heart rate variability, which require specialized equipment and invasive procedures, vocal parameters can be extracted from naturalistic speech recordings with minimal participant burden. The robustness and consistency of stress-related changes in F0 and NNE suggest that these parameters may have utility not only for basic research on stress mechanisms, but also for applied contexts including remote mental health monitoring, occupational stress assessment, and clinical evaluation of stress-related disorders.

However, several open questions remain. First, while the current study examined acute, time-limited stress in a university sample, it is unclear whether similar patterns would emerge under chronic stress or in clinical populations characterized by dysregulated stress responses (e.g., anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder). Second, the present analyses focused on global acoustic features aggregated across speech tokens; future work should examine whether stress effects vary as a function of phonetic context, speaking task, or communicative intent. Finally, the mechanisms linking stress to NNE reduction remain incompletely understood and would benefit from simultaneous measurement of vocal acoustics, laryngeal imaging, and physiological indices of autonomic function.

## Conclusion

In summary, acute academic stress elicits coordinated changes in vocal production characterized by simultaneous increases in arousal (F0 elevation) and control (NNE reduction). These patterns challenge simplistic models of stress-induced vocal degradation and instead support a dual-process framework in which stress modulates the voice along dissociable physiological and regulatory dimensions. The consistency and magnitude of these effects, combined with substantial between-person variability, underscore the potential of vocal acoustics as a sensitive, ecologically valid marker of acute stress. Future research integrating vocal analysis with neurophysiological and psychological assessments will further illuminate the mechanisms through which stress reshapes human communication.
